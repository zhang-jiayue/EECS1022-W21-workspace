/* Problem:
 * 
 * You are required to build classes for managing a store,
 * 	 where records of available movies are stored in different zones. 
 * 
 * A store has up to 100 zones.
 * 
 * Each zone stores a collection of movie records.
 * When first created, a zone is set with a capacity 
 * (i.e., maximum total number of movie DVDs). 
 * 
 * Each movie record is characterized by its name, number of available DVDs, and located zone.
 * You can assume that within a zone, there are no two movie records with the same name. 
 * 
 * A zone's status is a summary of its stored movie records. 
 * 	However, if the last invoked mutator resulted in an error (e.g., due to insufficient space in the zone), 
 * 	then the zone's status should be updated to the corresponding error message.
 * 
 * For other functionalities, details, and examples, see below for the test methods and in-line comments.

	/*
	 * Programming Requirements:
	 * 	- You are only allowed to use primitive arrays (e.g., int[], String[], Facility[]) 
	 * 		for declaring attributes and implementing methods.
	 * 	- Any use of a Java library class or method is forbidden 
	 * 		(that is, use selections and loops to build your solution from scratch instead):
	 * 	- Here are some examples of forbidden classes/methods: 
	 * 		- Arrays class (e.g., Arrays.copyOf)
	 * 		- System class (e.g., System.arrayCopy)
	 * 		- ArrayList class
	 * 		- String class (e.g., substring).
	 * 	- The use of some library classes does not require an import statement, 
	 * 		but these classes are also forbidden to be used.
	 * 	- Here are the exceptions (library methods which you are allowed to use if needed):
	 * 		- String class (equals, format)
	 * 
	 * You will receive an immediate zero if this requirement is violated.
	 */
	
	/*
	 * Your expected workflow should be:
	 * Step 1: Eliminate compilation errors. 
	 * 	Declare all the required classes and methods (returning default values if necessary), 
	 * 	so that the project contains no compilation errors (i.e., no red crosses shown on the Eclipse editor).
	 * Step 2: Pass all unit tests. Add private attributes and complete the method implementations accordingly, 
	 * 	so that executing all tests result in a green bar.
	 * 
	 * If necessary, you are free to declare (private or public) helper methods.
	 * 
	 * Any new classes that are ***not*** indicated by the given JUnit tests will be ***disregarded*** in grading.
